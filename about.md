Iâ€™m Lalith Suresh, a co-founder at <a href="https://www.feldera.com">Feldera</a>.

I was previously (2016-2023) a senior researcher at <a href="https://research.vmware.com/">VMware Research</a> in Palo Alto.
There, I led efforts to simplify cluster management for large-scale distributed systems. I also
worked on topics like failure detection, programmable networking, Big Data, and remote memory.

I hold a PhD in computer science from <a href="http://www.tu-berlin.de">TU-Berlin</a> (2016)
and a joint Masters degree in distributed computing from <a href="https://www.kth.se/en/">
KTH, Stockholm</a> and <a href="https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/">IST, Lisbon</a> (2012).
