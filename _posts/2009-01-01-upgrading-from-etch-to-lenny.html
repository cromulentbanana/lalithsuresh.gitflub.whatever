It's the first day of the new year, and amidst the hassle of being one of the admins conducting the online semester registration for the students, I decided to upgrade my ageing Debian Etch to it's testing release, Debian Lenny. Upgrading from one version to another has never been so easy! Just go through the following steps.<p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0000ff;">$: sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list</span><p>
<p>
Now replace every occurrence of 'etch' with 'lenny'. To be on the safer side, comment out all 3rd party repositories as Lenny is still in testing.<p>
<p>
Next,<p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0000ff;">$: sudo apt-get update</span><p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0000ff;">$: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade</span><p>
<p>
You might have to do the dist-upgrade step a couple of times till it upgrades no further. I know some people have had problems while trying to do an Etch-&gt;Lenny upgrade, but things have been quite OK for me. If you're not using one of the Debian packaged kernels (you built your own kernel from source), make sure apt-get doesn't override your kernel headers. In case it does, and you notice that some of your device drivers are acting up, just go through the following steps:<p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0000ff;">$: cd /usr/src/linux </span><p>
<p>
<span style="color:#888888;">(if you don't have the symlink, cd into wherever your kernel is!)</span><p>
<p>
<span style="color:#0000ff;">$: sudo make headers_install</span><p>
<p>
Although I didn't have to do the last step, I believe it should solve your device driver issues after your upgrade, if any. Do correct me otherwise.<p>
<p>
And yes, almost forgot...<p>
<h2><strong>Happy New Year everyone!</strong></h2>
