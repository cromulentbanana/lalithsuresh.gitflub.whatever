The last few weeks have been full of surprises! My research team got a poster accepted at "Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) 2010", which is quite a prestigious international conference. The poster covers our recent work in speeding up Logic Simulation of digital circuits using General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs). Although the work is still in progress, it presents some of our (promising) initial results as we explored novel approaches to simulating circuits on a GPGPU. This of course, came as a surprise to all of us because we weren't sure if our work was good enough for a conference like DATE! But oh well. :)

Meanwhile, something that really hit me hard was when another one of my papers didn't get accepted into an IEEE sponsored conference. In the paper, I'd proposed a simple, straightforward and highly resource efficient countermeasure to the Collusion Attack against OLSR based Mobile Ad Hoc Networks. The simulation results (ns-3 FTW) were promising as well. What made me feel worse was that none of the reviewers rejected the paper! The paper got ratings of 5/5, 4/5 and 3/5 from each reviewer respectively, but citing some weird reasons, the paper was ultimately not accepted. And sadly, none of the reviewers gave any useful comments as well, two of them _completely_ missing the entire point behind the paper!

Maybe that's how research works. Not everyone gets what you're doing, and not everyone's equally convinced about the same piece of work. Something you strongly claim might be turned down by others from the community. Similarly, something that you do may impress others more than yourself. Fun isn't it? :)

There are a few more surprises but that's as much as I'd like to talk about here. :)

Meanwhile, it's still unclear what I'll be doing for the next one year. Until last week, I was worrying myself to the last nerve, since I'm barely two months away from graduation. Strangely enough, I'm convinced that something good will come up for me soon. Maybe next week, maybe next month, maybe even a day after I graduate. And no, I don't remember any accident that could have rewired my brain cells to make me this optimistic. It just happened I guess!

With many lessons learnt, and many habits un-learnt, seems like I've changed quite a bit over the past one month. Oh well, I'd rather be a flowing river than a puddle of stagnant water. After all, it's the latter that attracts the mosquitoes. Right? :)
