Ever so rarely, I find a poem that gives me goosebumps every time I read it. One such poem is Invictus, by William Ernest Henley.

The poem is perhaps best known for having been a favourite of Nelson Mandela, who used to recite it to his fellow inmates. 

This tribute by the one and only [Zen Pencils](http://zenpencils.com/comic/140-invictus-a-comic-tribute-to-nelson-mandela/) is therefore
something I keep coming back to.
