If you're not aware already, the <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/">4th International Workshop on NS-3 (WNS3) 2012</a> is just around the corner. We're almost done with the organising and have a very interesting lineup of presentations. Tom Henderson and Mathieu Lacage will be giving keynote talks. We then have <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/accepted-papers/">12 full paper presentations</a> spread across the day, and a shared poster session with the Omnet++ workshop for which we have <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/accepted-demos/">8 posters/demo</a> submissions from our side. Have a look at the final program <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/accepted-demos/">here</a>.<p>
<p>
If you're an ns-3 user, don't miss this chance to share ideas and learn more about what researchers from around the globe are upto with the project. Don't forget, there's also the <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/DevelMeetingMarch2012">developers' meeting</a> the next day. Just add yourself to the wiki if you're interesting in attending in person or remotely.<p>

Now if only I can find a damn youth hostel in Desenzano...
