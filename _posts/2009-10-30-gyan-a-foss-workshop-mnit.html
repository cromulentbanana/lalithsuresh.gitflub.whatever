Neuron '09, a technical fest, was held between 23rd and 24th of October, 2009 in my institute and I must say, those guys managed to pull it off pretty well! A once in a blue moon situation, most of the events violated the 'Indian Standard Time' rule by actually beginning and ending on time! When's the last time you saw that happen here? Anyways, as always, we from the MNIT Open Source User Mesh (MOSUM) decided to conduct a little FOSS workshop during the three day programme. The 24th of October was the auspicious date as per the alignment of the planets (yeah right). So just like we did with all our other workshops that happened during our tech fests, we decided to bring in speakers from outside. <a href="http://lonetwin.blogspot.com/">Steven Fernandez</a> (who works for Druvaa, and is also a former Red Hat employee) talked about the FOSS ecosystem, how it works and how one can be a part of it. <a href="http://jaipandya.com/">Jai Pandya</a> (JECRC, Jaipur) followed with a beginner oriented talk on Wordpress and how to use it setup a website in under 5 minutes. Finally, I took over with a not-so-beginner-oriented talk on parallel programming using OpenMP (#pragma anyone?). Furthermore, the turnout of 120 was far more than any of us expected! Wonder if the city of Jaipur is really awakening. Let's just hope that we see new faces turning up for our <a href="http://www.lugj.in">LUG-Jaipur</a> meets from here on. :)
