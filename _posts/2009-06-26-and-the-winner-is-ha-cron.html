The Sun Code For Freedom contest <a href="http://in.sun.com/communities/univ/codeforfreedom/winners.jsp">results</a> are finally out and my pet project, <a href="http://hacron.dev.java.net">HA-Cron</a>, has been declared the first prize winner. :)<p>
<p>
My old HP Compaq 6515b laptop had served me well for 2 years and now, it's got zero battery life, no sound (it's always been like that) and a touch-pad that goes crazy after 5 minutes of usage. Now, with the new Dell laptop I'll be getting, I can actually setup a proper cluster! Good thing Open HA Cluster 2009.06 allows you to setup a cluster with just one NIC (cheers to Crossbow). Can't wait to give this a spin!<p>

Congratulations to all the other winners as well!
