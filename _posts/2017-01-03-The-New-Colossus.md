Given the news lately, [The New Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Colossus) by Emma Lazarus seems very relevant.

<em>
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,  <br>
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;  <br>
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand  <br>
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame  <br>
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name  <br>
MOTHER OF EXILES. From her beacon-hand  <br>
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command  <br>
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  <br>
<br>
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she  <br>
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,  <br>
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,  <br>
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.  <br>
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,  <br>
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!  <br>
