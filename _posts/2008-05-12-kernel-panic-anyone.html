I've been trying to build a very customized debian for quite a while and doing so obviously involves manually compiling your own kernel. So I fetch the 2.6.25.1 kernel (vanilla sources), stable version, unpack it and create the necessary symlink. After checking the right options for my ATI Radeon X1200 graphics card which really sucks ass, I compile the kernel, copy the bzImage to /boot, configure grub and reboot. From grub, I select my new kernel and while I was thinking of what next to fetch for my system, I am greeted with the following message.
<br />

<br />Kernel panic – not syncing : VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unkown-block (0,0</blockquote><blockquote></blockquote>
<br />Lo! The infamous kernel panic. I encountered the same problem while working on one of the college servers which was to be set up for being the new gateway. After compiling the kernel for Iptables support and rebooting into it, I got the same error, only that the available options were different. It showed the only hda device on the system that is, the CD-ROM drive.
<br />
<br />Now after looking into a lot of forums, I decided there wasn't any clear cut solution provided on how to solve the problem. Unless you really DID append an incorrect “root=” option, the problem lies in the fact that your kernel is not able to recognize your SATA device (sda). Chances are, it's been compiled for IDE support.
<br />
<br />The solution? Compile your kernel for SATA support.
<br />
<br /><blockquote>$: cd /usr/src/linux
<br />$: make menuconfig</blockquote>

These are the options that I'd set according to my hardware. If you're not able to figure out what the right options are, select everything! As far as the gateway was concerned, I'd selected almost everything which looked sensible enough.
<br />
<br />Finally
<br />
<br /><blockquote>$: make clean &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make modules_install
<br />$: cp arch/x86/boot/bzImage /boot/your-kernel-version</blockquote>
<br />
<br />The last step would be to update grub.
<br /><blockquote>$: vi /boot/grub/menu.lst
<br />
<br />title Your Linux
<br />root (hd0,0)
<br />kernel /boot/your-kernel-version root=/dev/sda1
<br /></blockquote>

<br />Hope this little write up proves helpful. Cheers. Feel free to post a comment if you have any problems.
