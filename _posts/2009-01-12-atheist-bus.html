Absolutely despicable. What else can I say? Even though I'm an atheist and I do agree that religion is doing as much harm as good, I'm totally against the idea of atheists trying to propagate their thoughts by putting up banners everywhere. If you're going to express your atheism in an in-your-face manner, you have no moral right to blame missionaries from the Church (or whatever) for what they're doing (this statement has been made with reference to a comment on one such 'Atheist bus' blog). Talk about hypocrisy! I pride in being an atheist and I like keeping quiet about it. I only react when I'm provoked or when someone tries to stuff their beliefs down my throat. Come to me and tell me something like, "Hey, I wonder how you survive without any faith... Don't you ever feel like visiting a temple?... How do you appear for an exam without asking for God's support?... etc", and I will definitely give you an overdose of what I think and a few more things (a kick in the nuts perhaps) as a token of my appreciation.Â I don't know what this is about people trying to tell the entire world about their faith in God (or lack thereof). Can't we all keep quiet about this? Isn't it inevitable that no one's ever going to agree on religion, especially in a country like India where everything seems to revolve around it.<p>

Religion is something that you can't prove right or wrong, but that which you choose to believe is right. If you know you're right, why the heck do you care about those around you? Just get on with your own lives...</div>
