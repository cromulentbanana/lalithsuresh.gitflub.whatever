Lisbon. A truly European city, deeply intertwined with its rich cultural heritage. A city of castles, palaces, and other historic structures. Of cuisine that seduces one's sense of taste. Of night clubs, bars and pubs, reflecting a vigour of the highest order. Of amazing friends, ethnic kaleidoscopes, parties and breathtaking visits.

And last, but by no means the least, of Distributed Computing. :)
