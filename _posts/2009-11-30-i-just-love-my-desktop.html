I _love_ eye candy. :)<p>
<p>
I know a lot of people would disagree, claiming that it doesn't offer any increase in productivity for a developer and only uses up resources, but what the heck! I've got 4 Gigs of RAM to burn, and even when I'm running two OpenSolaris VMs in my Ubuntu, my Compiz doesn't chug! This in spite of the fact that I'm using an Intel based shared memory graphics card. :)<p>
<p>
Anyhow, I recently installed Terminator which is a really slick x-term emulator that offers you a single terminal window which you can split into multiple ones (either horizontally or vertically). I'm used to leaving Alt+T as my key binding to start a new terminal, but the problem is, when you set this binding from the System-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts menu, it is set to launch gnome-terminal instead of your default x-terminal-emulator. Now since I was in one of those lazy moods where I didn't feel like finding out the right config file (among the millions out there) to tweak, I decided to go for the not-so-graceful way of solving the issue:<p>
<blockquote>$: sudo mv /usr/bin/gnome-terminal /usr/bin/gnome-terminal-old<p>
<p>
$: sudo ln -s /usr/bin/terminator /usr/bin/gnome-terminal</blockquote><p>
Done! Here's my Desktop with terminator running (that's cairo-dock on the left by the way):<p>

Peace! :)
