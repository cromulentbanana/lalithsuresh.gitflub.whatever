Since its development, I've been seeing a lot of requests for an ns-3-click 101. So with no further ado, here's the first in a series of tutorials to help you get an idea of how to go about using ns-3-click. In this article, I'll provide an idea of what ns-3-click is and how to install it .<p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. What is ns-3-click?</strong></span><p>
<p>
ns-3-click, or the NS-3 Click Integration, is a feature of the ns-3 tool which allows a user to use a Click Modular Router instance to handle an ns-3 node's layer 3 functionality. Click is an architecture for designing highly flexible router configurations. Basically, it offers a large number of fine grained packet processing units called "elements", which can be put connected in various combinations into a Click graph. A Click graph defines a particular configuration for a router. The motivation for bringing Click into ns-3 is simple. Click users get to test their Click graphs in a powerful simulation environment which ns-3 offers, and ns-3 benefits from the large feature set that Click brings with it in the form of elements. In ns-3-click, the design choice was to entirely delegate ns-3's layer 3 functionality to Click. This means that an ns-3 node running a Click router will now have to use Click's implementations of ARP, routing tables and so forth.<p>
<p>
So before you get started with ns-3-click, I suggest going through [0] and [1]. The first paper should tell you everything you need to know about what Click is, and the second one will inform you about where Click fits into ns-3. The latter will help you understand what ns-3-click can or cannot do for you.<p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2. Installation</span></strong><p>
<p>
By now, you know what ns-3-click is, and its time to get your hands dirty. The first step is to download and build Click.<p>
<p>
<code>$: git clone git://read.cs.ucla.edu/git/click DIR<p>
$: cd DIR<p>
$: ./configure --enable-nsclick --enable-userlevel<p>
</code><p>
<p>
Note: If you require additional modules, enable them as required using the --enable-&lt;module&gt; flag.<p>
<p>
Now build Click:<p>
<p>
<code> $: make<p>
</code><p>
<p>
Once this is complete, we need to build ns-3 and point it to the Click source we've just compiled. So let's proceed to fetch and build ns-3. Note that ns-3-click was merged post ns-3.10, and will be released with ns-3.11. It is currently available in ns-3-dev.<p>
<p>
<code>$: hg clone http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dev<p>
$: cd ns-3-dev<p>
$: ./waf configure --with-nsclick=&lt;path-to-click-source&gt; --enable-examples</code><p>
<p>
Once the last command has finished executing, you should see a list of features/modules that have been enabled. At this point, you should see the following line:<p>
<p>
<code>NS-3 Click Integration        : enabled</code><p>
<p>
Now, let's build ns-3:<p>
<p>
<code>$: ./waf build<p>
</code><p>
<p>
If all goes well, ns-3 should now be built successfully. To test whether things went well, try running one of the example scripts.<p>
<p>
<code>$: ./waf --run nsclick-simple-lan</code><p>
<p>
This should generate some PCAP traces (nsclick-simple-lan-*.pcap). If you see packets being exchanged in there, then you're good to go!<p>
<p>
This concludes part I of the ns-3-click tutorial. In the next part, I'll provide a code walk through of a simple example script that uses ns-3-click. If you find any bugs with ns-3-click, please don't hesitate to file a bug report on our <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/bugzilla/">bugzilla</a>. :)<p>
