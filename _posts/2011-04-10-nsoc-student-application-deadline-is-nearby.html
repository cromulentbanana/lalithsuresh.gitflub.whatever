The <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/NSOC2011">NS-3 Summer of Code</a> programme has received a good deal of interest from students so far, and I'm pretty excited to see what the final set of applications will look like.

Anyhow, hurry up students, the deadline for NSoC is on the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">15th of April, 2011 at 19:00 UTC</span>! Visit the <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/NSOC2011">NSoC wiki</a> to find information regarding the applying process. Meanwhile, we recommend that you discuss your proposals as much as possible on the ns-developers mailing list and with your potential mentors before you apply to keep your proposal focused and polished.
