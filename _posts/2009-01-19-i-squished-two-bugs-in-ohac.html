At last, I've managed to contribute code to open source! Although they're just two very trivial and super easy oss-bite-sized bugs, something's better than nothing. What say? One bug fix was in the <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/ha-clusters/ohac/GDS-template/">GDS coding template</a> where I corrected a minor mistake with the local_zone_zsh() function. I stumbled upon it while developing HA-Cron, one of my <a href="http://in.sun.com/communities/univ/codeforfreedom/">Code For Freedom</a> projects. The <a href="http://bugs.opensolaris.org/view_bug.do?bug_id=4616225">other bug</a> involved me correcting some improper cluster boot messages.<p>
<p>
Both this fixes are coming out with the next release of <a href="http://opensolaris.org/os/community/ha-clusters/ohac/">OHAC</a>.  w00t! ^^
