I successfully defended my <a href="http://lalithsuresh.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/lalith-thesis.pdf">master's thesis</a> last Friday, and with that, I've now officially completed a two year Msc programme in Distributed Computing. If I were to describe the programme with three words, it would be fun, beer, and bananas.<p>
<p>
Headed back to Berlin on an airplane, by a window seat, in a reflective mood that would be fitting for a sepia filter, I've made a list of the lessons I've learnt over this latest epoch of my life:<p>
<ul><p>
	<li>It's one thing to read about different cultures, it's another thing to experience them.</li><p>
	<li>Dreams don't always work out. Be prepared to fail hard.</li><p>
	<li>Don't chase achievements. Focus on doing good work, and opportunities will come to you.</li><p>
	<li>There are always elements outside your realm of control. As my supervisor tells me, it's called life.</li><p>
	<li>Be patient. Very patient.</li><p>
	<li>Beer *always* works out.</li><p>
</ul><p>
Darned window seat, making me reflective and all.
