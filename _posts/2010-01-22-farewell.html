I always feared this day would come, and it finally has. So with a heavy heart, I bid <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/jag/entry/so_long_old_friend">farewell to Sun Microsystems</a>. Thanks to all those of you who made my one and a half years at Sun a wonderful experience. To wrap it up, all I've got to say is, "until we meet again!"
