When it comes to things like caste-based reservations in the Indian education
system, or questions about enabling more diversity in tech, you often
find the M-word, _meritocracy_, being thrown around.

Some believe every competition in life should be based on a pure meritocracy. Others disagree.

Think of this post as an illustrated guide to the different viewpoints in
place, but without colours.

=====================================================================


### An ideal meritocracy.
A fair race, where everyone starts and ends the race at the same points. Utopian all the way.
Many seem to believe the world looks like this.

### What reality looks like.
Not everyone starts at the same lines, but are expected to make it to the same finish lines.
A survival-of-the-fittest kind of scenario, if you may. Or if you like how French sounds, _c'est la vie_.
Or as the Germans would say, _das Leben ist kein Ponyhof_.

### What affirmative action looks like.

Not everyone starts at the same starting lines, and now people get to run
abritrarily unequal distances to complete the _same_ race. Many believe that
this is the solution to the problem of having different starting lines. In
general, this tends to do more damage than good, especially when the end
result looks like the train-wreck that is the Indian reservation system.
