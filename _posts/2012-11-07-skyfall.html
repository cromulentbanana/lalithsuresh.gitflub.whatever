When you watch Skyfall with three fellow networking researchers, comments such as the following ensue:<p>
<blockquote>"Why is the list of all agents on a single file, on a single laptop hard drive, and encrypted so weakly that it's crackable in less than a week?"<p>
<p>
"Wait. How can you even trace someone after you strip the headers off the packet?"<p>
<p>
"That's a CISCO switch in that data center! ... Huh? What terrible wiring. Where's the cooling system? Is that a data center built with raspberry pies?"<p>
<p>
"I can see assembly code on that terminal."<p>
<p>
"Who the hell plugs-in a terrorist's laptop to your security sensitive internal network?"<p>
<p>
"From where does that little radio transmitter's antenna get that much power to transmit such a signal in the first place?"</blockquote><p>
I love being around fellow nerds.
