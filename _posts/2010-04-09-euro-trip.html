A few days ago, I lived a part of my life which I like to call Happiness. Yes, I was finally accepted into the European Masters in Distributed Computing programme and that too with a Category A Erasmus Mundus scholarship. This programme is being offered by the consortium of universities formed by Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Sweden; Instituto Superior Técnico (IST), Portugal and Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Barcelona. My study track involves being in IST, Portugal for the first year; KTH, Sweden during my 3rd semester and finally having my Master's Thesis evaluated from IST, Portugal. Furthermore, my good friend <a href="http://www.facebook.com/navaneeth.rameshan?ref=profile">Navaneeth</a> has been offered the same course _and_ the same study track as well, to the relief of our parents. :)

So here's how the python list of my life looks like:

<code>life.journey = ['Tehran, Iran', 'Calicut, India', 'Doha, Qatar', 'Palakkad, Kerala', 'Jaipur, India']
life.journey.append ('Lisbon, Portugal')
life.journey.append ('Stockholm, Sweden')</code>

Guess it's time for a Euro trip then eh? :)
