OLSR HNA support is officially up on ns-3-dev. If you don't wish to pull the latest ns-3-dev snapshot, feel free to apply the following two patches to your source tree:

1) HNA support, mixed interfaces support and helper improvement for OLSR. (<a href="http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dev/rev/12bb87242796">Patch</a>)

2) MID fix for mixed interface integration. (<a href="http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dev/rev/c5b36fbaa9c8">Patch</a>)

Once you've applied the patches, you may check out <a href="http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3-dev/file/12bb87242796/examples/routing/olsr-hna.cc">examples/routing/olsr-hna.cc</a> which illustrates how to use the HNA API.
