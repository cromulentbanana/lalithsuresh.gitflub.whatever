We're organising the fourth annual Workshop on NS-3, to be held in conjunction with <a href="http://simutools.org/2012/">SIMUTools 2012</a>. The workshop will be held on March 23rd, 2012, in Sirmione, Italy. Details regarding the important dates, submission guidelines, and the scope of the workshop is available on the <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/">WNS3 2012 site</a>.<p>
<p>
The workshop serves as an annual gathering of ns-3 users and developers to share ideas, and brainstorm over future directions for the project. We're inviting conference style full paper submissions, which will be made available in the ACM and EU digital proceedings. Furthermore, we're also hosting an interactive session comprising of demos and posters. So start working on your papers and proposals as soon as possible! If you have any queries, feel free to <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wns3/wns3-2012/contact/">contact</a> the workshop chairs.<p>
<p>
Like previous editions of the workshop, we also plan to conduct a day long ns-3 developers' meeting around the same time. More details will be out soon. Keep an eye on our mailing lists and website to not miss any announcements.<p>
