Today, my colleague [Udi](https://udiwieder.wordpress.com) introduced me to Hieronymus Bosch's "[The Garden of Earthly Delights](http://www.esotericbosch.com/Garden.htm)". I'm far from being an art connoisseur, but I'm speechless.

More than an hour in, I still haven't made it past the central panel.
