Unfortunately, ns-3 wasn't selected as a mentoring organisation for GSoC 2011. But don't worry, it doesn't end with that. We are keen on self organising a summer of code programme of our own, so that we can support some student projects and offer mentoring for the same over the summer. While we haven't decided on the exact plan yet, it is on our agenda for next week's <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/DevelMeetingMarch2011">ns-3 developers' meeting</a> at Barcelona, co-located with <a href="http://simutools.org/2011/">Simutools 2011</a> and <a href="http://www.wns3.org/2011/">WNS3 2011</a>. So stay tuned for updates from our end. If you have any ideas, suggestions or expectations from such a programme, feel free to get in touch with me and let me know what you think.
