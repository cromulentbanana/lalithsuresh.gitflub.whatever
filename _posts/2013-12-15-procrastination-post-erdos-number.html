<p>In waiting for my combinatorial explosion of a factorial design experiment to complete, I decided to find out what my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number">Erdos Number</a> looks like, which is basically defined as  the collaborative distance between yourself and the famous mathematician, Paul Erdos. Turns out, I have an Erdos number of 4 via the following chain of co-authorship.</p>

<p>/me -- Anja Feldmann -- Edward G. Coffman, Jr -- Joel H. Spencer -- Paul Erd≈ës.</p>

<p>You can calculate your Erdos number <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/collaborationDistance.html">here</a>.</p>
