Last week's Barcelona trip was the perfect weekend getaway from a hectic masters programme. After a not-so-enjoyable stint with changing hostels on Thursday, I met my colleagues from <a href="http://www.upc.edu/">UPC, Barcelona</a> for a nice round of drinks and tapas. I left for the <a href="http://www.melia-barcelona.com/en/melia-barcelona.html">Melia Barcelona</a> early next day for <a href="http://www.wns3.org/2011">WNS3 2011</a>, and I was obviously excited about meeting the rest of the ns-3 developers for the first time. It's been more than a year of my involvement with the project, and so far it's been an amazing experience to work with the really awesome people that comprise of the ns-3 community. So meeting the faces behind the names from the mailing list was something I was looking forward to, and I did. A lot of hand shakes and introductions later, we got started with the <a href="http://www.wns3.org/2011/Programme/Schedule">programme</a>. My talk went pretty well too.

After the talks, we Â had a pre-meeting for next day's <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/DevelMeetingMarch2011">ns-3 developers</a> meeting in order to decide the agenda, the priorities, and the action items we planned to walk away with (note that beer is part of the schedule :) ). The day ended with an amazing dinner at a rather classy restaurant in the city.

The developers meeting took place at the <a href="http://www.cttc.es/index.jsp">CTTC</a> demo center on Saturday and lasted around 7 hours in total including lunch, during which we discussed and planned ahead as far as solving a number of issues was concerned. We also came to a consensus on organising an <a href="http://www.nsnam.org/wiki/index.php/NSOC2011">NS-3 Summer of Code</a> programme, for which I'll be handling the reigns. All in all, it was an awesome experience to meet these guys, from whom I've been learning a lot over the past year. :)

So in short, life is good. :)
